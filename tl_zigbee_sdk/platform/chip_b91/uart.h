 *	How to use this driver
 *	==============
 - The uart two working modes nodma/dma,can be used as follows:
    -# UART Initialization and Configuration
         -# dma/nodma:
             - To prevent the uart module from storing history information, before use call uart_hw_fsm_reset API;
             - Initializes the tx/rx pin by uart_set_pin API;
             - Configure the baud rate/stop bit/ parity by uart_cal_div_and_bwpc/uart_init API;
         -# dma
             - Configure rx_timeout by uart_set_rx_timeout;
             - The default value of tx_done is 1, which needs to be cleared,by uart_clr_tx_done API;
             - dma initial configuration by uart_set_tx_dma_config/uart_set_rx_dma_config API;
    -# UART interrupts handling
       -# nodma:data is received via rx_irq interrupt,and err receive detection.
             - rx_irq interrupt:when the number of rxfifo reaches the threshold uart_rx_irq_trig_level, the rx_irq is interrupted,
               configured by uart_rx_irq_trig_level/uart_set_irq_mask(UART_RX_IRQ_MASK) API;
             - detect the UART receives data incorrectly(such as a parity error or a stop bit error),configured by uart_set_irq_mask(UART_ERR_IRQ_MASK) API;
                 - If err occurs during the receiving process, perform the following operations: 
                    -# uart_hw_fsm_reset();
                    -# uart_clr_rx_index();
                    -# clear the data received in ram buff;
             - uart module interrupt enable and total interrupt enable by plic_interrupt_enable/core_interrupt_enable API;
       -# dma:use tx_done and rx_done(or dma tc_mask) to check whether the sending and receiving are complete,and err receive detection when rx_done.
             - tx_done:use the tx_done of the uart module,use uart_set_irq_mask(UART_TXDONE_MASK);
             - rx_done:use rx_done of uart module rx_done,use uart_set_irq_mask(UART_RXDONE_MASK) (When the length of the send is not known):
                  - After rxdone is generated and before configuring the next dma, the rxfifo hardware pointer must be set to 0 (uart_hw_fsm_reset())
                    in order to prevent the next dma from working properly due to the rxfifo pointer not being in the default state(When the sending length is greater than the receiving length).
                  - When the send length is less than the receive length, although the rxdone interrupt is generated, the dma has not reached the configured length, and the dma is still working.
                    When configuring the next dma, dma_chn_dis() needs to be configured before the next dma(this action has been processed in uart_receive_dma).
             - tc_mask:use tc_mask of dma module,use dma_set_irq_mask() : TC_MASK (If the transmission length is fixed):
                  - A dma interrupt can only occur if the receive length is equal to the length configured by the dma.
                  - If the dma stops working and reconfigures it, perform the following operations:
                      -# uart_hw_fsm_reset();
                      -# uart_receive_dma();(dma_chn_dis has been implemented in uart_receive_dma())
             - If err is displayed during dma receiving, the recommended action is as follows:
                      -# uart_hw_fsm_reset();
                      -# uart_receive_dma();(dma_chn_dis has been implemented in uart_receive_dma())
             - uart module interrupt or dma module interrupt enable and total interrupt by plic_interrupt_enable/core_interrupt_enable API;
    -# UART enter suspend sleep before and after handling
        -# nodma_tx:
              - before no dma tx goes to suspend sleep, it is necessary to judge the uart busy bit to ensure the completion of UART data transmission.
              - after suspend sleep wake up, perform the following operations: 
                      -# uart_clr_tx_index();
                      -# clear the send data in ram buff;
        -# nodma_rx
              - If go to suspend sleep during no dma rx, the recommended action when waking up is as follows: 
                      -# uart_clr_rx_index();
                      -# clear the data received in ram buff;
        -# dma:
              - If go to suspend sleep during dma sending, the recommended action when waking up is as follows:
                      -# uart_send_dma();(dma_chn_dis has been implemented in uart_send_dma())
              - If go to suspend sleep during dma receiving, the recommended action when waking up is as follows:
                      -# uart_receive_dma();(dma_chn_dis has been implemented in uart_receive_dma())
    -# UART TX and RX
         -# nodma_tx
            - It can be sent in byte/half word/word polling, use uart_send_byte/uart_send_hword/uart_send_word API;
         -# nodma_rx
            - data is received via rx_irq interrupt,the data is read in the interrupt by uart_read_byte API;
         -# dma_tx
            - send data by uart_send_dma API;
         -# dma_rx
            - receive data by uart_receive_dma API;
    -# Note:
         - the points to note when receiving nodma:
            - Since there is no rxdone interrupt under nodma:
                - if the length of the received data is not known, rx_level should be set to 1;
                - if the length of the received data is known, rx_level should be set to less than 8 and an integer multiple of the received length;
            - rx_irq interrupt processing: Use uart_get_rxfifo_num() to determine the number of FIFOs and use uart_read_byte() to read all data in fifo;
            - The depth size of the uart fifo is 8. If the time before and after entering the rx_irq interrupt exceeds the time of receiving 8 bytes, the fifo pointer may be disturbed, resulting in abnormal received data.
              You can determine whether uart_get_rxfifo_num() is greater than 8 as an exception,If this exception occurs, it is recommended to use dma mode to receive.
         - the points to note when receiving dma:
            - the receive length needs to be calculated manually by uart_get_dma_rev_data_len API;
            - Advantages of this method: prevents rx_buff from crossing boundaries;
            - Possible problems:
                - the receive length cannot be greater than the DMA set length,otherwise excess data will be discarded.
                - In an application, there may be a high priority interrupt source that interrupts the uart rx_done interrupt processing sequence,
                  in interruption period,if the next data is received to the fifo, when the re-entry of the UART RX_DONE interrupt,resulting in the error in computing the received length of the current data.
                - The two packets of data are very close to each other, but the rx_done signal of the previous data has also been generated. Before the rx_done interrupt flag and rx_fifo software are cleared,
                  the next data has been transferred, which leads to the error of clearing.
            - When using DMA to receive data, if rx_done occurs and there's data in rx fifo, rx fifo needs to be cleared for the next dma transmission. 
              in B91, clearing rxbuff interrupt status won't work, therefore requiring uart_hw_fsm_reset() function to do this operation,
              But using uart_hw_fsm_reset() function might break dma tx transmission, potentially causing data loss.
 - The UART flow control CTS/RTS
      -# CTS(when the cts pin receives an active level, it stops sending data)
         - Configure the cts pin and polarity,by uart_cts_config API;
         - enable cts,by uart_set_cts_en;
      -# RTS(In automatic mode,when the condition is reached, the rts active level is activated, and in manual mode, the rts level can be manually controlled)
         - Configure the rts pin and polarity,by uart_rts_config API;
         - enable rts,by uart_set_rts_en;
         - the rts has two modes:manual and auto
            - manual: can change the RTS pin's level manually,the related interfaces are as follows: uart_rts_manual_mode/uart_set_rts_level API;
            - auto:When the set conditions are met, rts is activated,there are two conditions as follows:
                   - When the number of rxfifo reaches the set threshold, rts is activated,when rx_fifo is less than the set threshold then rts will go down;
                     the related interfaces are as follows:uart_rts_auto_mode/uart_rts_trig_level_auto_mode API;
                   - Generates an rx_done signal,rts is activated,When rx_done is cleared, the rts signal automatically goes down,
                     the related interfaces are as follows:uart_rts_auto_mode API;
 - Support S7816
    -# S7816(used to communicate with the s7816,for details, see driver s7816)
        - This is just to talk specifically about the rtx function:
           - Configure the rtx pin and enable,by uart_set_rtx_pin/uart_rtx_en API;
           - this pin can be used as either tx or rx,it is the rx function by default,When there is data in tx_fifo and the interface uart_rtx_pin_tx_trig is called,
             it is converted to tx function until tx_fifo is empty and converted to rx.

     -# The maximum baud rate depends on the hardware environment (such as cable length, etc.) and pclk/cclk/hclk:
         - pclk is the main factor affecting the upper baud rate of UART
         - cclk and pclk affect interrupt processing times(increase the frequency of cclk will increase the maximum baud rate of NDMA, but it has no obvious effect on the maximum baud rate of DMA)
     -# The maximum baud rate must meet two testing conditions: 
         - proper parsing by the logic analyzer
         - successful communication on the development board
     -# Note on the actual use of the maximum baud rate:
         - if only communication on the development board is considered, the baud rate can be set higher
         - setting a significantly higher baud rate may result in a deviation between the set and actual baud rates, leading to incorrect parsing by the logic analyzer and possible communication failures with other devices
